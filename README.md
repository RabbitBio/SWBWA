# SWBWA

A high-accuracy and high-performance short read aligner optimized for the next-generation Sunway platform.

## Features

- Redesigned a parallel framework tailored for Sunway’s heterogeneous architecture, with software prefetching and memory access optimizations in bigshare mode.

- Achieves up to **330×** speedup over the unoptimized single-thread version, and **1.2–1.4×** faster than [bwamem](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) on a dual-socket 48-core x86 server with nearly identical results.

## Build

SWBWA can only support the next-generation Sunway platform.

### Dependency

- sw9gcc (7.1.0 or newer)  
- zlib

### Compilation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RabbitBio/SWBWA.git
cd SWBWA
make -j4
```

## Simple usage

### Index the reference

SWBWA is compatible with index files generated by [bwamem](https://github.com/lh3/bwa).

```bash
./SWBWA index ref.fa
```

### Align reads

- Single-end:

```bash
./SWBWA mem ref.fa reads.fq -o aln.sam
```

- Paired-end:

```bash
./SWBWA mem ref.fa read1.fq read2.fq -o aln.sam
```
